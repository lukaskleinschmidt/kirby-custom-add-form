# Custom Add Form
A small demo on how to hijack the panel add route for a specific template to display a different or modified form.

## Installation
To install the plugin, please put it in the `site/plugins` directory.  
The plugin folder must be named `custom-add-form`.

```
site/plugins/
    custom-add-form/
        custom-add-form.php
        ...
```

Change `[template-name]` on line 13 to whatever template you want to modify the add form in the `custom-add-form.php` file.
